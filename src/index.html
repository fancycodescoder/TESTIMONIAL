                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. 
                    I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                    I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. 
                    I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, 
                    I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”

                    “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. 
                        I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                        The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. 
                        The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. 
                        In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. 
                        It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
